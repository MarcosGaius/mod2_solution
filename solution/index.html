                Designed by Peter Moore, the Jordan 1 originally released from 1985 to 1986. Quite a few colorways of the model were produced, 
                as well as a few different variations. Following its initial run in the 80s, the Jordan 1 jumpstarted the retro era in 1994, following Jordan's retirement 
                from basketball. The shoe returned again in 2001, including the introduction of a Jumpman branded mid-top. It wasn't until 2008 that Jordan Brand started
                re-releasing the Jordan 1 with its original high cut.
